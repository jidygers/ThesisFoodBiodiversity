# ThesisFoodBiodiversity
Research on diversity indices applied to food intake data
Food biodiversity indices were used to calculate a food biodiversity score per person based on of the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study. 
1. "Indices calculations performed by IARC 23 november" was used to calculate the food biodiversity scores
2. "Indices calculations" is provided to facilitate quicker calculation of the food biodiversity scores 
3. "Hill_inf DifferenceQ1Q5" is used to calculate the probability of classifying persons in the lowest quintile while they belong in the lowest and vice versa
4. "Percentage of NCLASS groups" is created to calculate the percentage of foods that are not converted into species-level
5. "Jill_x calculation" calculates a newly created index in order to better align with the values of Hill_2
6. "Indices visualisation v3" is created to analyse and visualise the calculated food biodidversity scores
7. "Abundance plot of cohort calculation and visualisation" is used to calculate and visualise the on average most consumed species
